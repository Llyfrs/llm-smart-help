# About 

Here are tools I used for mostly data gathering and preprocessing. Scripts included here are not used in the final project. 


## Scripts

### `html_to_markdown.py`
This script converts HTML files to markdown format. The process is specifically designed to handle HTML pages from the https://wiki.torn.com/ site, as it specifically removes certain sections and handles some table formating that doesn't produce good tables when only converted using the used parser.
